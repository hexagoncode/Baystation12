changes: 
  - tweak: "The shield generator has been reworked. It is now much more expensive to keep the shields on continuously, and for large shields it's likely not viable."
  - rscadd: "The shield generator now has an idle and active state (as well as the off state). In the idle state, it consumes limited power and does not generate a shield. In the active state, it consumes a lot of power and produces a shield."
  - rscadd: "If an idle generator is toggled on, it takes a short amount of time to spin up to active state. If an active generator is toggled to idle, it will switch to that state instantly."
  - rscadd: "There are several levels of idle power usage that can be selected. Higher power usage decreases the spin-up time proportionately."
  - rscadd: "The shield generator takes time to adjust the radius of the shield. The radius will not be adjusted while the shield is active."
  - tweak: "The shield generator's power storage has been vastly expanded."
  - tweak: "The shield generator's field integrity is now tracked separately from the power storage (it's determined by the amount of power stored, up to a threshold)."
